- 👋 Hi, I’m @nadira36
- 👀 I’m interested in using tiled to gamify my coaching practice...
- 🌱 I’m currently new and lost...I followed a link and am now here and hoping it eventually makes sense. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not a lot. I have no clue what I'm doing and don't like the uncomfortable feeling of being totally lost when I'm normally the expert in my field. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... I'm not sure why anyone here would want to reach a n00b like me. I assume there's a social aspect here?
